# Mini-SQL-Engine

* Please keep the format of input, table names, column names same as in Assignment pdf.

* Also, I have assumed that all the files to be read, shell script and the python file will be kept in same directory during execution.

* In ```2020201007.sh``` file, 
I have written ```python3 2020201007.py "$1"```
You can replace it by ```python 2020201007.py "$1"```, if it's not working in your machine.
